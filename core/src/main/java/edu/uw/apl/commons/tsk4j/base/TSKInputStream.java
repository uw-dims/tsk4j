 * An abstract InputStream capturing the logic shared between various
 * TSK4J classes which offer the user an InputStream interface for
 * reading data.  We delegate to concrete classes the implementation
 * of 'readImpl'.
 *
 * @see edu.uw.apl.commons.tsk4j.image.Image.ImageInputStream
 * @see edu.uw.apl.commons.tsk4j.filesys.File.FileInputStream
 * @see edu.uw.apl.commons.tsk4j.filesys.Attribute.AttributeInputStream
 * @see edu.uw.apl.commons.tsk4j.filesys.Partition.PartitionInputStream
 *
 * @see java.io.InputStream
 *
 * This class maintains two values: size is total byte count of the
 * object being read via this InputStream, and posn is where the next
 * read would occur.  Since InputStreams offer noo 'rewind' facility,
 * once posn == size, we are at EOF and any further reads return -1.
